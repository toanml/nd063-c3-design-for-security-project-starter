Critical Vulnerabilities
- IAM.6 & IAM.9: Enable Hardware MFA for the Root User
-- Action: Set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the root user account. Use a hardware MFA device for enhanced security.

High Vulnerabilities
- EC2.13 & EC2.14: Restrict Ingress Rules for Security Groups
-- Action: Modify security group rules to disallow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 (all IPs) to ports 22 (SSH) and 3389 (RDP). Limit access to specific IP addresses or ranges that require access.
- EC2.2: Restrict VPC Default Security Groups
-- Action: Update the default security group to deny all inbound and outbound traffic by default. Create specific security groups for instances with only the necessary rules.
- CloudTrail.1: Enable and Configure CloudTrail
-- Action: Enable AWS CloudTrail and configure it to have at least one multi-region trail that captures both read and write management events. Ensure that the logs are stored securely.

Medium Vulnerabilities
- IAM.11 to IAM.15: Strengthen IAM Password Policy
-- Actions:
--- Require at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one symbol, one number, and a minimum password length of 14 characters.
--- Prevent password reuse by enforcing a policy that disallows the last 5 passwords.
--- Set a password expiration policy to require password changes every 90 days.

Low Vulnerabilities
- IAM.16: Prevent Password Reuse
-- Action: Implement a password policy that tracks previously used passwords to prevent reuse.
- IAM.17: Set Password Expiration Policy
-- Action: Enforce a policy that requires passwords to expire within 90 days.
- IAM.18: Create a Support Role for Incident Management
-- Action: Create a dedicated IAM role for managing incidents with AWS Support, ensuring it has appropriate permissions while following the principle of least privilege.
