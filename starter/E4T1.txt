# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

Preventing SSH Brute Force Attacks
To prevent SSH brute force attacks, we can:

- Restrict Security Groups: Limit SSH access to the Web Service instance from a bastion host, requiring attackers to first compromise the bastion host. 
-- Remove the rule allow SSH port 22 from any source
- Apply Least Privilege: Restrict outbound SSH connections on the attacker EC2 instance if they are unnecessary.
-- Remove the rule allow all trafic from any source
- Use Immutable Instances: Disable all SSH connections to EC2 instances, deploying new machine images for changes and terminating the old instances.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

Securing the Secret Recipe S3 Bucket
First, turn off public access to the secret recipe S3 bucket. Since the accessing instance was within our VPC, we need further security by applying a bucket policy that restricts read access to a specific security group. This group should include only authorized users and resources that need access to the bucket.
